# How to #

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# Build #

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

# Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

-- @TODO No test was implemented.
